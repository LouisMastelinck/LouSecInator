# LouSecInator
This project contains a **test executable** specifically designed to trigger incidents in **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)**.   It was created in my personal time as a demonstration tool to support discussions, workshops, and hands-on labs around **incident response and investigation techniques**.
